## Quick Start

### Clone the repo and download the model
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendatalab/UniMERNet.git
```

```bash
cd UniMERNet/models
# Download the model and tokenizer individually or use git-lfs
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/wanderkid/unimernet
```

### Installation

``` bash 
conda create -n unimernet python=3.10

conda activate unimernet

pip install --upgrade unimernet
```

### Running UniMERNet

1. **Streamlit Application**: For an interactive and user-friendly experience, use our Streamlit-based GUI. This application allows real-time formula recognition and rendering.

    ```bash
    unimernet_gui
    ```
    Ensure you have the latest version of UniMERNet installed (`pip install --upgrade unimernet`) for the streamlit GUI application.

2. **Command-line Demo**: Predict LaTeX code from an image.

    ```bash
    python demo.py
    ```

3. **Jupyter Notebook Demo**: Recognize and render formula from an image.

    ```bash
    jupyter-lab ./demo.ipynb
    ```


## Performance Comparison (BLEU) with SOTA Methods.

> UniMERNet significantly outperforms mainstream models in recognizing real-world mathematical expressions, demonstrating superior performance across Simple Printed Expressions (SPE), Complex Printed Expressions (CPE), Screen-Captured Expressions (SCE), and Handwritten Expressions (HWE), as evidenced by the comparative BLEU Score evaluation.

## UniMER Dataset
### Introduction
The UniMER dataset is a specialized collection curated to advance the field of Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER). It encompasses the comprehensive UniMER-1M training set, featuring over one million instances that represent a diverse and intricate range of mathematical expressions, coupled with the UniMER Test Set, meticulously designed to benchmark MER models against real-world scenarios. The dataset details are as follows:

**UniMER-1M Training Set:**
  - Total Samples: 1,061,791 Latex-Image pairs
  - Composition: A balanced mix of concise and complex, extended formula expressions
  - Aim: To train robust, high-accuracy MER models, enhancing recognition precision and generalization

**UniMER Test Set:**
  - Total Samples: 23,757, categorized into four types of expressions:
    - Simple Printed Expressions (SPE): 6,762 samples
    - Complex Printed Expressions (CPE): 5,921 samples
    - Screen Capture Expressions (SCE): 4,742 samples
    - Handwritten Expressions (HWE): 6,332 samples
  - Purpose: To provide a thorough evaluation of MER models across a spectrum of real-world conditions

### Dataset Download
You can download the dataset from [OpenDataLab](https://opendatalab.com/OpenDataLab/UniMER-Dataset) (recommended for users in China) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wanderkid/UniMER_Dataset).


## Training

To train the UniMERNet model, follow these steps:

1. **Specify the Training Dataset Path**: Open the `configs/train` fold and set the path to your training dataset.

2. **Run the Training Script**: Execute the following command to start the training process.

    ```bash
    bash script/train.sh
    ```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the dataset path specified in the `configs/train` fold is correct and accessible.
- Monitor the training process for any errors or issues.

## Testing

To test the UniMERNet model, follow these steps:

1. **Specify the Test Dataset Path**: Open the `configs/val` fold and set the path to your test dataset.

2. **Run the Test Script**: Execute the following command to start the testing process.

    ```bash
    bash script/test.sh
    ```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the dataset path specified in the `configs/val` fold is correct and accessible.
- The `test.py` script will use the specified test dataset for evaluation. Remember to change the test set path in test.py to your actual path.
- Review the test results for performance metrics and any potential issues.
## TODO

- [x] Release inference code and checkpoints of UniMERNet.
- [x] Release UniMER-1M and UniMER-Test.
- [x] Open-source the Streamlit formula recognition GUI application. 
- [x] Release the training code for UniMERNet.
